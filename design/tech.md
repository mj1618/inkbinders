Use NextJS, Typescript, Convex.dev - and if you need css use Tailwind.
Create a new convex project yourself (don't touch any existing ones).

Also - whenever you need to create assets there is a NANOBANANA_API_KEY in .env.local

I would prefer you use your own game framework rather than using something like Phaser.
Do what makes sense - but if you can do it yourself, do it, if that gets too hard then reach for something.
